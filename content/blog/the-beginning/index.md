description: Introduction to my blog
---

It's always exciting to start something new and now I've decided to start my own blog.

I will be using this blog primarily to document my own learning experience concerning various topics including programming, web development, Linux and technology. As someone who just recently switched over to the Linux world, I will be referring back to this blog for when I encounter that installation error then I'll know exactly what to do.  

Hopefully this blog will help others as much as it will help me as I continue to learn and develop my skills as a developer and Linux user.
