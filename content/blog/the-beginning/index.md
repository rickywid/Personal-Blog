description: Introduction to my blog
---

It's always exciting to start something new and now I've decided to start my own blog.

I will be using this blog primarily to document my own learning experience concerning various topics including programming, web development, Linux and technology. As someone who just recently switched over to the Linux world, I will be referring back to this blog for when I encounter again that stubborn installation error and know immediately what to do in order to resolve it.  

Hopefully this blog will help others as much as it will help me as I continue to learn and develop my skills as a developer and Linux user.

Happy learning to all and let the journey begin...
